        "The **Study Habit Coach** is an R-based rule-based expert system that provides students with study advice depending on their daily habits and routines. Upon execution, the program interacts with the user via a sequence of console prompts, which inquire about five essential questions pertaining to their study time, sleep time, level of distraction, quality of study environment, and whether they are facing an upcoming exam. For yes/no questions, input validation is built into the system to ensure valid processing. Based on what the user answers, the program applies a set of conditional rules using `if-else` statements as the inference engine for the system. Each rule checks for some conditions and offers suggestions based on themâ€”such as suggesting extra study time if the user studies less than two hours a day, improvements in sleeping, or suggesting against the use of techniques such as the Pomodoro technique in order to reduce distractions. All the output is presented in straightforward, understandable language, making the feedback easy to comprehend. This expert system is simple, intuitive, and designed to accommodate good study habits. It can also be extended with additional rules or a graphically based interface with widgets like Shiny."
